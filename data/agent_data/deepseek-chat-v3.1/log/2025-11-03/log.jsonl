Generate proper trading signals with confidence levels\n2. Calculate precise stop-losses using ATR\n3. Verify portfolio status and buying power\n4. Execute trades with proper risk management\n\n**For now, the professional decision is to stand aside and preserve capital.**\n\nWould you like me to help with any specific market observations or educational aspects of day trading while we wait for the technical tools to be restored?"}}
