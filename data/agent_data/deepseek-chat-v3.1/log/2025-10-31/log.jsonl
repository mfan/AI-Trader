That has especially been the case for a handful of top-performing Fidelity Investments funds, along with the $334 million Matthew 25 Fund [MXXVX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/mxxvx/quote) and the iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF [USXF](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/usxf/quote), each of which have over 20% weightings of Nvidia in their portfolios.\n\nTwo Fidelity funds with over $200 billion between them have large Nvidia weightings, exemplified by the $20.6 billion Fidelity Series Growth Company Fund [FCGSX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fcgsx/quote) and the $14.6 billion Fidelity Series Blue Chip Growth Fund [FSBDX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fsbdx/quote), each of which has Nvidia as its largest holding.\n\nShares Skyrocket on AI Boom\n---------------------------\n\nThe $5 trillion milestone came on the heels of Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in Washington, D.C., where the firm made multiple big announcements. It revealed it had ample order backlogs for its Blackwell and Rubin chips. “We’re pleasantly surprised by this disclosure,” says Morningstar analyst Brian Colello. “We think it implies about $300 billion of data center revenue to be earned in calendar 2026 [fiscal 2027], above FactSet estimates.”\n\nThe firm also revealed deals with Oracle [ORCL](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/orcl/quote) and Nokia [NOK](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/pinx/n\n...\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n📰 Article 3\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n🔗 URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\n📌 Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Stock Price, News, Quote & History - Yahoo Finance\n📝 Description: Find the latest NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) stock quote, history, news and other vital information to help you with your stock trading and investing.\n📅 Published: unknown\n\n📄 Content:\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Stock Price, News, Quote & History - Yahoo Finance\n\n===============\n\nOops, something went wrong\n\n[Skip to navigation](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/#ybar-navigation)[Skip to main content](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/#nimbus-app)[Skip to right column](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/#right-rail)\n\n### [News](https://www.yahoo.com/)\n\n*   [Today's news](https://www.yahoo.com/news/)\n*   [US](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/)\n*   [Politics](https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/)\n*   [World](https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/)\n*   [Weather](https://www.yahoo.com/news/weather/)\n*   [Climate change](https://www.yahoo.com/tagged/climate-change/)\n*   [Health](https://www.yahoo.com/news/health/)\n\n    *   [Wellness](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/)\n\n        *   [Mental health](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/mental-health/)\n        *   [Sexual health](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/sexual-health/)\n        *   [Dermatology](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/dermatology/)\n        *   [Oral health](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/oral-health/)\n        *   [Hair loss](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/hair-loss/)\n        *   [Foot health](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/foot-health/)\n\n    *   [Nutrition](https://health.yahoo.com/nutrition/)\n\n        *   [Healthy eating](https://health.yahoo.com/nutrition/healthy-eating/)\n        *   [Meal delivery](https://health.yahoo.com/nutrition/meal-delivery/)\n        *   [Weight loss](https://health.yahoo.com/nutrition/weight-loss/)\n        *   [Vitamins and supplements](https://health.yahoo.com/nutrition/vitamins-supplements/)\n\n    *   [Fitness](https://health.yahoo.com/fitness/)\n\n        *   [Equipment](https://health.yahoo.com/fitness/equipment/)\n        *   [Exercise](https://health.yahoo.com/fitness/exercise/)\n\n    *   [Women’s health](https://health.yahoo.com/womens-health/)\n    *   [Sleep](https://health.yahoo.com/sleep/)\n    *   [Healthy aging](https://health.yahoo.com/healthy-agin\n...\n\nUse this context to decide holds/trims/exits and complete the workflow.\n\nReview the data, complete any remaining news checks, and update the portfolio accordingly."}]}

That has especially been the case for a handful of top-performing Fidelity Investments funds, along with the $334 million Matthew 25 Fund [MXXVX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/mxxvx/quote) and the iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF [USXF](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/usxf/quote), each of which have over 20% weightings of Nvidia in their portfolios.\n\nTwo Fidelity funds with over $200 billion between them have large Nvidia weightings, exemplified by the $20.6 billion Fidelity Series Growth Company Fund [FCGSX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fcgsx/quote) and the $14.6 billion Fidelity Series Blue Chip Growth Fund [FSBDX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fsbdx/quote), each of which has Nvidia as its largest holding.\n\nShares Skyrocket on AI Boom\n---------------------------\n\nThe $5 trillion milestone came on the heels of Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in Washington, D.C., where the firm made multiple big announcements. It revealed it had ample order backlogs for its Blackwell and Rubin chips. “We’re pleasantly surprised by this disclosure,” says Morningstar analyst Brian Colello. “We think it implies about $300 billion of data center revenue to be earned in calendar 2026 [fiscal 2027], above FactSet estimates.”\n\nThe firm also revealed deals with Oracle [ORCL](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/orcl/quote) and Nokia [NOK](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/pinx/n\n...\n\nUse this context to decide holds/trims/exits and complete the workflow.\n\nReview the data, complete any remaining news checks, and update the portfolio accordingly."}]}

That has especially been the case for a handful of top-performing Fidelity Investments funds, along with the $334 million Matthew 25 Fund [MXXVX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/mxxvx/quote) and the iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF [USXF](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/usxf/quote), each of which have over 20% weightings of Nvidia in their portfolios.\n\nTwo Fidelity funds with over $200 billion between them have large Nvidia weightings, exemplified by the $20.6 billion Fidelity Series Growth Company Fund [FCGSX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fcgsx/quote) and the $14.6 billion Fidelity Series Blue Chip Growth Fund [FSBDX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fsbdx/quote), each of which has Nvidia as its largest holding.\n\nShares Skyrocket on AI Boom\n---------------------------\n\nThe $5 trillion milestone came on the heels of Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in Washington, D.C., where the firm made multiple big announcements. It revealed it had ample order backlogs for its Blackwell and Rubin chips. “We’re pleasantly surprised by this disclosure,” says Morningstar analyst Brian Colello. “We think it implies about $300 billion of data center revenue to be earned in calendar 2026 [fiscal 2027], above FactSet estimates.”\n\nThe firm also revealed deals with Oracle [ORCL](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/orcl/quote) and Nokia [NOK](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/pinx/n\n...\n\nUse this context to decide holds/trims/exits and complete the workflow.\n\nReview the data, complete any remaining news checks, and update the portfolio accordingly."}]}

It revealed it had ample order backlogs for its Blackwell and Rubin chips. “We’re pleasantly surprised by this disclosure,” says Morningstar analyst Brian Colello. “We think it implies about $300 billion of data center revenue to be earned in calendar 2026 [fiscal 2027], above FactSet estimates.”\n\nThe firm also revealed deals with Oracle [ORCL](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/orcl/quote) and Nokia [NOK](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/pinx/n\n...\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n📰 Article 2\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n🔗 URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/30/is-nvda-stock-overvalued/\n📌 Title: Is Nvidia Stock Overvalued?\n📝 Description: The artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader's stock is trading at an attractive valuation, in my opinion.\n📅 Published: 2025-10-30T09:30:00.000Z\n\n📄 Content:\nIs Nvidia Stock Overvalued? | The Motley Fool\n\n===============\n\nSkip to main content Enable accessibility for low vision Open the accessibility menu\n\n![Image 4: Spinner: White decorative](https://cdn.userway.org/widgetapp/images/spin_wh.svg)\n\n![Image 5: A 60x60 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://cdn.userway.org/widgetapp/images/body_wh.svg)\n\n![Image 6: Spinner: White decorative](https://cdn.userway.org/widgetapp/images/spin_wh.svg)\n\n[Accessibility Menu](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/30/is-nvda-stock-overvalued/#)\n\nSearch for a company \n\n[▲ S&P 500**+194%**|▲ Stock Advisor**+1056%**Join The Motley Fool](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=39d61c98-fcb6-494c-a9f7-a3fe2c89e9f9&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-top-nav-returns%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditn0000028%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Dfoolcom_supernav%26ftm_pit%3D14137)\n\n[Accessibility](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/30/is-nvda-stock-overvalued/#)Log In[Help](https://support.fool.com/)\n\n[![Image 7: The Motley Fool](https://g.foolcdn.com/misc-assets/logo-tmf-primary-1-magenta-purple-reversed.svg?_w=320)![Image 8: The Motley Fool](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Fmisc-assets%2Ftmf_holdingco_logo_stacked_magenta_royalpurple_rev.png&w=96&op=resize)](https://www.fool.com/)\n\n*   Our Services[All Services](https://www.fool.com/services/)[Stock Advisor](https://www.fool.com/services/stock-advisor/)[Epic](https://www.fool.com/services/epic/)[Epic Plus](https://www.fool.com/services/epic-plus/)[Fool Portfolios](https://www.fool.com/services/fool-portfolios/)[Fool One](https://www.fool.com/services/one/)[Podcasts Home](https://www.fool.com/podcasts/)[Motley Fool Money](https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/)[Rule Breaker Investing](https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/)[The Motley Fool Foundation](https://foolfoundation.org/) \n*   S\n...\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n📰 Article 3\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n🔗 URL: https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/NVDA\n📌 Title: __symbol__ Stock Quote Price and Forecast | CNN\n📝 Description: View NVIDIA Corporation NVDA stock quote prices, financial information, real-time forecasts, and company news from CNN.\n📅 Published: unknown\n\n📄 Content:\nNVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\nNVIDIA Corp. engages in the design and manufacture of computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software.

Published: 2025-10-30T17:26:21.511Z\n\n📄 Content:\nKey Takeaways\n-------------\n\n*   Nvidia stock is up nearly 50% in 2025, as booming AI demand has sent its market cap over $5 trillion.\n*   Fidelity fund strategies managing over $200 billion in assets have gone in big on the stock.\n*   The fund with the largest weighting to the stock is the Matthew 25 Fund, followed by iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF.\n\nNvidia’s [NVDA](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/nvda/quote) huge rally, which has made it the first $5 trillion company in history, has provided a big boost for funds

It revealed it had ample order backlogs for its Blackwell and Rubin chips. “We’re pleasantly surprised by this disclosure,” says Morningstar analyst Brian Colello. “We think it implies about $300 billion of data center revenue to be earned in calendar 2026 [fiscal 2027], above FactSet estimates.”\n\nThe firm also revealed deals with Oracle [ORCL](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/orcl/quote) and Nokia [NOK](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/pinx/n\n...\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n📰 Article 3\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n🔗 URL: https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/NVDA:NASDAQ\n📌 Title: Google Finance - Stock Market Prices, Real-time Quotes & Business News\n📝 Description: Google Finance provides real-time market quotes, international exchanges, up-to-date financial news, and analytics to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\n📅 Published: unknown\n\n📄 Content:\nGoogle Finance - Stock Market Prices, Real-time Quotes & Business News\n\n===============\n\n[Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/)\n\nFinance\n\n[Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/)\n\n[](https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/products?tab=eh)\n\n[Sign in](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?passive=1209600&continue=https://www.google.com/finance/&followup=https://www.google.com/finance/&ec=GAZAGw)\n\n[![Image 1: A 74x24 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://ssl.gstatic.com/images/branding/googlelogo/svg/googlelogo_clr_74x24px.svg) Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/)\n\n[_finance\\_mode_ Home](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/ \"Home\")\n\n[_manage\\_search_ Market trends](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/markets/indexes \"Market trends\")\n\nPortfolios\n\n_add_\n\nCreate portfolio\n\nWatchlists\n\n_add_\n\nCreate watchlist\n\nMost Active\n\n[Amazon.com Inc +10.40%](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/quote/AMZN:NASDAQ \"Amazon.com Inc\")[NVIDIA Corp +0.14%](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/quote/NVDA:NASDAQ \"NVIDIA Corp\")[Nokia Oyj -4.56%](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/quote/NOK:NYSE \"Nokia Oyj\")[Opendoor Technologies Inc +5.45%](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/quote/OPEN:NASDAQ \"Opendoor Technologies Inc\")[Plug Power Inc -2.11%](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/quote/PLUG:NASDAQ \"Plug Power Inc\")[Ondas Holdings Inc -1.35%](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/quote/ONDS:NASDAQ \"Ondas Holdings Inc\")\n\n[_settings_ Settings](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/settings \"Settings\")[_feedback_ Send feedback](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/NVDA:NASDAQ \"Send feedback\")\n\n_expand\\_all_ Compare markets\n\nUS\n\nEurope\n\nAsia\n\nCurrencies\n\nCrypto\n\nFutures\n\n[Chevron among biggest Dow gainers after reporting record crude output;

AAPL (Apple Inc.)**\n- **Current P&L**: +0.41% ($60.28 gain)\n- **Position Size**: 15.1% of portfolio\n- **Current Price**: $270.68\n- **News Sentiment**: Neutral - No major catalysts found\n- **Decision**: **HOLD**\n- **Reasoning**: Position size is reasonable, slight profit, no negative news. Apple remains a solid long-term holding.\n\n**2. AMAT (Applied Materials)**\n- **Current P&L**: +0.03% ($2.00 gain) \n- **Position Size**: 7.8% of portfolio\n- **Current Price**: $246.65\n- **News Sentiment**: Positive - Morgan Stanley raised price target to $256\n- **Decision**: **HOLD**\n- **Reasoning**: Strong semiconductor equipment play, positive analyst sentiment, position size appropriate\n\n**3. GOOGL (Alphabet/Google)**\n- **Current P&L**: +0.86% ($114.00 gain)\n- **Position Size**: 13.7% of portfolio\n- **Current Price**: $280.17\n- **News Sentiment**: Mixed - Being compared to META in recent analysis\n- **Decision**: **HOLD**\n- **Reasoning**: Solid performer, modest gains, position size well within limits\n\n**4. NVDA (NVIDIA)**\n- **Current P&L**: -0.27% (-$43.05 loss)\n- **Position Size**: 16.1% of portfolio\n- **Current Price**: $203.22\n- **News Sentiment**: **VERY POSITIVE** - Just hit $5 trillion market cap milestone\n- **Decision**: **HOLD**\n- **Reasoning**: Despite small loss, NVDA just achieved historic milestone. Strong momentum suggests recovery potential.\n\n**5. PLTR (Palantir)**\n- **Current P&L**: -0.22% (-$41.58 loss)\n- **Position Size**: 19.6% of portfolio\n- **Current Price**: $199.25\n- **News Sentiment**: **CRITICAL** - Q3 earnings on November 3rd (3 days away)\n- **Decision**: **HOLD** (but monitor closely)\n- **Reasoning**: Position is slightly oversized but earnings catalyst is imminent. Better to hold through earnings than sell right before.\n\n### **PORTFOLIO REBALANCING NEEDS:**\n\n✅ **Good Portfolio Balance:**\n- All positions under 20% maximum limit\n- Good diversification across tech sectors\n- Cash position healthy at 27.8%\n- No immediate rebalancing required\n\n### **OVERALL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY:**\n\n**DECISION: MAINTAIN CURRENT POSITIONS**\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. **No positions exceed risk limits** - All under 20% threshold\n2. **No significant losses** - Only small unrealized losses on NVDA and PLTR\n3. **Positive catalysts ahead** - PLTR earnings in 3 days, NVDA at historic milestone\n4. **Cash position adequate** - 27.8% cash provides flexibility for future opportunities\n5. **Diversification maintained** - Spread across different tech subsectors\n\n### **MONITORING PRIORITIES:**\n- **PLTR earnings on November 3rd** - Will need to react to results\n- **NVDA momentum** - Watch for continued strength after $5T milestone\n- **Market conditions** - Monitor for broader market trends\n\n**Final Portfolio State:**\n- **Total Value**: $98,336.78\n- **Cash**: $27,309.22 (27.8%)\n- **Positions**: 5 stocks\n- **Unrealized P&L**: +$92.03\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
