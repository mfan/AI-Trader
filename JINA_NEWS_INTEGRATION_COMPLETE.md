## 📰 How the Agent Uses News

### Step 1: Gather Information
The agent is instructed to search for news as part of data gathering:
```
1. GATHER INFORMATION
   - Get current prices: get_latest_price(symbol)
   - Check account: get_account()
   - Review positions: get_positions()
   - 📰 SEARCH NEWS: search_news("stock symbol news") or get_company_info("SYMBOL")
```

### Step 2: Analyze News Sentiment
The agent analyzes news for positive/negative catalysts:
```
2. ANALYZE MARKET CONDITIONS
   - Compare current prices vs yesterday
   - Evaluate profit/loss on existing positions
   - 📰 ANALYZE NEWS SENTIMENT: Check for positive/negative catalysts
   - Consider recent earnings, product launches, regulatory changes
```

### Step 3: Make Informed Decisions
News is integrated into the decision-making criteria:
```
3. MAKE DECISIONS
   - Identify buy/sell opportunities based on:
     • Technical factors (price trends, support/resistance)
     • Fundamental factors (earnings, revenue growth)
     • 📰 NEWS CATALYSTS (breaking news, market events)
```
