# Portfolio Management Upgrade - Complete Documentation

**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Objective**: Upgrade AI-Trader to enable active portfolio management by the AI agent

---

## üéØ Upgrade Overview

Transformed the AI trading agent from a **passive buyer** into an **active portfolio manager** who:
- Reviews existing positions FIRST before looking for new trades
- Makes data-driven decisions on each position (HOLD, ADD, TRIM, EXIT)
- Implements strict risk management and position sizing rules
- Rebalances portfolio to maintain diversification
- Takes profits on winners and cuts losses on losers

---

## üìã What Changed

### 1. **Enhanced Agent Prompt** (`prompts/agent_prompt.py`)

#### A. New Mission Statement
Changed from simple "trading assistant" to **"professional portfolio manager"**:
```
Your Mission:
- üìä ACTIVELY MANAGE existing portfolio positions
- üìà Analyze market conditions using real-time data
- üí∞ Make informed trading decisions to maximize returns
- ‚öñÔ∏è Execute trades through Alpaca's professional infrastructure
- üõ°Ô∏è Maintain portfolio risk and position sizing discipline
```

#### B. Critical First Step - Portfolio Review
Added mandatory 4-step portfolio review process:
1. Call `get_portfolio_summary()` - See complete portfolio at once
2. Call `get_account()` - Check cash and buying power
3. Call `get_positions()` - Analyze each position
4. For EACH position, call `get_company_info(symbol)` - Check news

#### C. Portfolio Management Rules

**Position Sizing Rules:**
- MAXIMUM per position: 20% of portfolio value
- IDEAL diversification: 5-10 positions
- NEW position sizing: 5-10% of portfolio
- Example: $10,000 portfolio ‚Üí max $2,000 per stock

**Profit Taking Rules:**
- UP 20%+: Take 50% profits, let rest run
- UP 50%+: Take 75% profits minimum
- Position >25% of portfolio: MUST trim

**Risk Management Rules:**
- DOWN 10%: Review company news
- DOWN 15%: Seriously consider selling
- DOWN 20%: MUST sell (stop loss)
- Negative news: Evaluate exit

**Portfolio Rebalancing:**
- Position >20%: Trim to 15%
- Position <3%: Add or exit completely
- Top 3 positions >60%: Reduce concentration
- Cash >50%: Look for opportunities
- Cash <10%: Raise some cash

#### D. New 4-Phase Trading Workflow

**OLD Workflow (5 steps):**
1. Gather information
2. Analyze market conditions
3. Make decisions
4. Execute trades
5. Manage risk

**NEW Workflow (4 phases - Portfolio-First):**

**Phase 1: PORTFOLIO REVIEW (DO THIS FIRST!)**
- Get portfolio overview
- Evaluate EACH existing position
- Make position decisions:
  - üü¢ Profitable positions (UP 10%+): Hold, trim, or take profits
  - üî¥ Losing positions (DOWN 5%+): Review, trim, or exit
  - ‚öñÔ∏è Rebalancing needs: Trim large positions, add/exit small ones

**Phase 2: IDENTIFY NEW OPPORTUNITIES**
- Search for trading candidates with positive news
- Analyze potential buys
- Check affordability and diversification

**Phase 3: EXECUTE PORTFOLIO CHANGES**
- SELL first (take profits, cut losses, rebalance)
- BUY second (deploy cash into new positions)
- Verify execution

**Phase 4: FINAL PORTFOLIO CHECK**
- Review final portfolio state
- Verify balanced position sizes
- Document decisions

#### E. Decision-Making Framework

Added systematic 5-question framework for EACH position:
1. Is this position profitable?
2. What does recent news say?
3. What % of portfolio is this?
4. What's the price trend?
5. Final decision: STRONG BUY, HOLD, TRIM, or EXIT

**Example Analysis:**
```
Stock: NVDA
Current P&L: +35% unrealized gain
Position size: 18% of portfolio
Recent news: Positive earnings beat
Price trend: Uptrend

Decision: TAKE 50% PROFITS
Reasoning: 
- Big winner (+35%), protect gains
- Position size OK (18%), but close to max
- Positive news supports keeping 50%
- Lock in profits, let rest run with house money
```

## üîë Key Concepts

### Portfolio-First Mindset
The agent now thinks like a professional portfolio manager:
- Existing positions are MORE important than new trades
- Risk management is MANDATORY, not optional
- Diversification is ENFORCED through position size limits
- Profit taking is SYSTEMATIC, not emotional
- Loss cutting is AUTOMATIC at -20%

### Active Management vs Passive Buying
**OLD Behavior:**
- Look for new stocks to buy
- Hold positions indefinitely
- No systematic profit taking
- No stop losses
- Risk growing too large positions

**NEW Behavior:**
- Review ALL positions FIRST
- Actively manage each position daily
- Take profits at +20%, +50%
- Cut losses at -15%, -20%
- Rebalance to prevent concentration

### Risk Management Discipline

**Position Sizing:**
- New positions: 5-10% of portfolio
- Maximum position: 20% of portfolio
- Ideal portfolio: 5-10 positions
- Small positions (<3%): Add or exit

**Profit Protection:**
- Lock in gains before reversals
- Let winners run, but take partial profits
- Prevent "round trips" (up big, then back to break-even)

**Loss Prevention:**
- Cut losses before they grow
- "Better to be wrong and small than wrong and big"
- Live to trade another day
