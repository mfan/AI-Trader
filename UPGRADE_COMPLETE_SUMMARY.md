## 🎯 4-Phase Trading Workflow

### Phase 1: Portfolio Review (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
1. `get_portfolio_summary()` - Complete portfolio view
2. `get_account()` - Cash and buying power
3. `get_positions()` - Each position details
4. For EACH position:
   - `get_company_info(symbol)` - Latest news
   - `get_latest_price(symbol)` - Current price
   - Analyze: P&L, size, news, trend
   - Decide: HOLD, ADD, TRIM, or EXIT

### Phase 2: Identify New Opportunities
1. `search_news("best performing stocks")` - Market research
2. `get_company_info(symbol)` - Company-specific news
3. `get_latest_price(symbol)` - Check prices
4. `get_stock_bars(...)` - Analyze trends
5. Verify buying power and diversification

### Phase 3: Execute Portfolio Changes
1. **SELL FIRST**: Take profits, cut losses, rebalance
   - `close_position(symbol, percentage=50)` - Partial exit
   - `close_position(symbol)` - Full exit
2. **BUY SECOND**: Deploy cash into new positions
   - `place_order(symbol, qty, "buy", "market")`
   - Size: 5-10% of portfolio
3. **VERIFY**: Check order execution
   - `get_orders(status="open")`
   - `get_positions()`

### Phase 4: Final Portfolio Check
1. `get_portfolio_summary()` - Review final state
2. Verify position sizes are balanced
3. Check cash reserves (10-30% ideal)
4. Document all decisions made

## 🎓 Decision Framework for Each Position

The agent asks 5 questions for EVERY position:

1. **Is this position profitable?**
   - YES (>10%) → Consider profit taking if large
   - NO (<-10%) → Review thesis, consider cutting

2. **What does recent news say?**
   - POSITIVE → Hold or add
   - NEUTRAL → Hold
   - NEGATIVE → Consider selling

3. **What % of portfolio is this?**
   - >20% → MUST trim
   - 10-20% → Good size
   - 5-10% → Could add if bullish
   - <5% → Too small, add or exit

4. **What's the price trend?**
   - UPTREND → Hold or add
   - SIDEWAYS → Hold or trim
   - DOWNTREND → Trim or exit

5. **Final decision**:
   - STRONG BUY: Add to position (if <15%)
   - HOLD: Keep as is
   - TRIM: Reduce by 25-50%
   - EXIT: Close position completely
