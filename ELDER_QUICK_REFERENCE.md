# Elder's Triple Screen Quick Reference Card

## 🚦 IMPULSE SYSTEM (Traffic Light)

```
🟢 GREEN = EMA↑ + MACD-Histogram↑
   → May BUY
   → Avoid shorts
   → Enter on breakout above resistance

🔴 RED = EMA↓ + MACD-Histogram↓
   → May SHORT
   → Avoid buys
   → Enter on breakdown below support

🔵 BLUE = Mixed signals
   → STAND ASIDE
   → Don't initiate new trades
   → Manage existing positions only
```

## 📊 TRIPLE SCREEN SYSTEM

```
SCREEN 1: Market Tide (Weekly MACD-Histogram)
├─ Histogram > 0 and rising → BULLISH TIDE (long only)
├─ Histogram < 0 and falling → BEARISH TIDE (short only)
└─ Mixed → CHOPPY (cash)

SCREEN 2: Market Wave (Daily Oscillators)
├─ Uptrend: Wait for Stochastic < 30 (pullback)
├─ Downtrend: Wait for Stochastic > 70 (bounce)
└─ Check Elder-Ray for confirmation

SCREEN 3: Intraday Entry (Impulse System)
├─ GREEN in uptrend → BUY on breakout
├─ RED in downtrend → SHORT on breakdown
└─ BLUE → Stand aside
```

## ⚡ ELDER-RAY

```
Bull Power = High - 13 EMA (bulls' strength)
Bear Power = Low - 13 EMA (bears' strength)

BUY Setup (Uptrend):
✅ Bull Power > 0 and rising
✅ Bear Power < 0 but shallow
✅ Impulse GREEN

SHORT Setup (Downtrend):
✅ Bear Power < 0 and falling
✅ Bull Power > 0 but shallow
✅ Impulse RED

DIVERGENCE WARNINGS:
⚠️ Price new high BUT Bull Power doesn't → Bearish
⚠️ Price new low BUT Bear Power doesn't → Bullish
```

## 🛑 SAFEZONE STOPS

```
LONG Position:
Stop = Current Low - (2 × Average Downside Penetration)

SHORT Position:
Stop = Current High + (2 × Average Upside Penetration)

MANAGEMENT:
✅ Set initial stop using SafeZone
✅ Move to breakeven at +1R profit
✅ Trail stop as price moves (tighten only)
❌ NEVER widen a stop - exit instead
```

## 🚨 THE 6% RULE (CRITICAL!)

```
IF monthly drawdown ≥ 6% THEN
   🛑 STOP TRADING immediately
   📚 Review losing trades
   🔍 Refine strategy
   ⏸️ Wait for next month
   ✅ Resume with clean slate
ELSE
   ✅ Continue trading
```

## 💰 THE 2% RULE

```
Maximum risk per trade: 2% of account

Position Size = (Account × 2%) / (Entry - Stop)

Example:
Account: $100,000
Risk: $2,000 (2%)
Entry: $150.00
Stop: $148.00
Risk/share: $2.00
Position: 1,000 shares

Total Portfolio Risk: ≤ 6% (max 3 positions)
```

## 📈 COMPLETE WORKFLOW

```
1. ✅ Check 6% Rule → Suspended? STOP
2. ✅ Screen 1 → Trend direction (long/short/cash)
3. ✅ Screen 2 → Find pullbacks/bounces
4. ✅ Screen 3 → Wait for Impulse color
5. ✅ Calculate position size (2% Rule)
6. ✅ Set SafeZone stop immediately
7. ✅ Manage: breakeven → trail → exit
8. ✅ Record trade & update risk metrics
```

## 🎯 DIVERGENCE SIGNALS

```
MACD-HISTOGRAM DIVERGENCES:

Bearish (Sell Signal):
├─ Price: Higher high
├─ MACD-Histogram: Lower high
└─ Action: Tighten stops on longs, prepare shorts

Bullish (Buy Signal):
├─ Price: Lower low
├─ MACD-Histogram: Higher low

## 🎓 KEY CONCEPTS

```
IMPULSE SYSTEM:
└─ Only trade when price and momentum agree
   ├─ EMA = Price trend
   ├─ MACD-Histogram = Momentum trend
   └─ Both agree → GREEN or RED
       Both disagree → BLUE (stand aside)

ELDER-RAY:
└─ Measures bull/bear power relative to consensus (EMA)
   ├─ Bulls strong when push above EMA
   ├─ Bears strong when pull below EMA
   └─ Divergences = trend exhaustion

SAFEZONE:
└─ Stops outside normal volatility "noise"
   ├─ Too tight = stopped out of good trades
   ├─ Too wide = excessive risk
   └─ 2× penetration = right balance

6% RULE:
└─ Automatic circuit breaker
   ├─ Prevents revenge trading
   ├─ Forces review after losses
   ├─ Preserves capital for recovery
   └─ Professional discipline enforcer

TRIPLE SCREEN:
└─ Multi-timeframe confirmation
   ├─ Screen 1 = Strategic (trend)
   ├─ Screen 2 = Tactical (entry)
   └─ Screen 3 = Execution (timing)
       All 3 must align!
```

## 🚀 POSITION SIZING EXAMPLES

```
EXAMPLE 1: Standard Long Trade
Account: $100,000
Risk: 2% = $2,000
Entry: $50.00
SafeZone Stop: $49.00
Risk per share: $1.00
Position Size: $2,000 / $1.00 = 2,000 shares
Total value: $100,000 (100% of account)
Actual risk: $2,000 (2% of account) ✅

EXAMPLE 2: Volatile Stock
Account: $100,000
Risk: 2% = $2,000
Entry: $200.00
SafeZone Stop: $190.00 (wider due to volatility)
Risk per share: $10.00
Position Size: $2,000 / $10.00 = 200 shares
Total value: $40,000 (40% of account)
Actual risk: $2,000 (2% of account) ✅

EXAMPLE 3: Tight Stop (Choppy Market)
Account: $100,000
Risk: 2% = $2,000
Entry: $100.00
SafeZone Stop: $99.50 (tight = low volatility)
Risk per share: $0.50
Position Size: $2,000 / $0.50 = 4,000 shares
Total value: $400,000 (4x leverage needed)
⚠️  REJECT: Exceeds buying power limits
→ Reduce to max buying power or skip trade
